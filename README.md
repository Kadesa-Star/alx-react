# Project Goals
* Understand Webpack fundamentals: Learn how Webpack works, its core concepts, and the role of loaders and plugins.
* Set up Webpack configuration: Create a configuration file (webpack.config.js) to bundle assets effectively.
* Optimize assets: Minify JavaScript and CSS, manage images and fonts, and configure Webpack to optimize files for production.
* Use Webpack with ES6 modules: Practice handling modern JavaScript imports and exports within a Webpack environment.
## Key Concepts to Cover
Webpack Configuration Basics: Set up entry, output, and mode (development vs. production) settings.
* Loaders: Learn to use loaders to handle various file types:
- Babel Loader: for ES6/ES7 JavaScript syntax transpilation.
- CSS and Style Loaders: for handling CSS files.
- File and URL Loaders: for images, fonts, and other assets.
* Plugins: Integrate plugins for different tasks:
- HtmlWebpackPlugin: Automatically generates an HTML file and injects script tags for bundled JavaScript.
- MiniCssExtractPlugin: Extracts CSS into separate files.
- OptimizeCSSAssetsPlugin and TerserPlugin: Minify CSS and JavaScript for production builds.
* Development Server: Configure webpack-dev-server for live reloading and fast development.
* Source Maps: Enable source maps to help with debugging in development mode.
